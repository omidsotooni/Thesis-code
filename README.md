# (Thesis code) Optimization Project with Bayesian Optimization and Pyomo

This project demonstrates optimization processes using Bayesian Optimization with GPyOpt and mathematical optimization models with Pyomo. It includes both bi-level and one-level optimization examples. The problem resolve for 9 Nodes and Sioux Falls netwroks and using in paper and thesis.
